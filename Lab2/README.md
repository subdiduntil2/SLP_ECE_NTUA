This zip contains all the necessary scripts to run the 
second lab of SLP NTUA. You should have kaldi installed 
and have downloaded the usc folder from the link https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_mIoioHMeC2HZtIbGs1LcL4kkIF696nB/view?usp=sharing

Then, you should copy the folder inside the the kaldi/egs directory
and inside the usc directory you should move all the bash and python scripts included
in this zip file. Finally, simply run the slp_lab2.ipynb notebook in a python environment.
